# 🎮 Game Development
I have been studying game development for the past 5 years. I started by doing My Bachelor in Games Programming and Design in London. Now I am in my last semester of my Games Master. I am also working for Lightbrick Studio, where I help developing games using Unity, helping with both Game/Level Design and programming.

I am currently working on personal side projects that might be released.

# 🕹️ Game Jams

I am a Game-Jam enthusiast, and try to participate in a few throughout the year!

Here's my [**itch.io page**](https://pedrorainha.itch.io/) for my games.
