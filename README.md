# 🎮 Game Development
I have been studying game development for the past 5 years. I started by doing My Bachelor in Games Programming and Design in London. Now I am in my last semester of my Games Master. I am also working for Lightbrick Studio, where I help developing games using Unity, helping with both Game/Level Design and programming.
